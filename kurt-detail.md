<p>This new publication covers the history of former SS-Obersturmfuhrer (1st Lieutenant) Kurt Sametreiter. This Austrian national volunteered for the SS less than 3 weeks after his country had been annexed by Germany, in 1938. This 15-year old boy had a selfish motivation for this, that was the need to find employment, but also sustainable employment.</p>
<p>This decision took him from his native Austria into Germany and by the end of World War Two, he had spent time in Poland, Holland, Belgium, France, Greece and the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This book allows us to follow most of those journeys through the photographs that Kurt Sametreiter and his friend, Heinz Klosowski took themselves. This journey took Kurt Sametreiter from a young boy through to an SS Officer and holder of Germany's highest award for bravery - the Knight's Cross.</p>
<p> Heinz Klosowski left his native Danzig and volunteered for the Waffen-SS in an effort to protect his homeland from aggression. This decision cost him his life on the Russian Front. It is a unique and fascinating insight into the lives of the Waffen-SS soldiers. The book itself contains:</p>
<ul class="over">
  <li>350 photographs - the vast majority from the personal archive of Kurt Sametreiter</li>
  <li>60 period documents that help provide additional detail</li>
  <li>20 maps that help orientate you to where the story unfolded</li>
</ul>
<p>This book has been designed to emulate the original war-time photo albums. The cover is produced with a thick, padded and embossed leatherette material. Inside are 176 pages filled with the history of these two men. The images are laid out on high quality, high gloss paper.</p>

<p><b>Each of this next 100 books are individually numbered and contain the stamped signature of Kurt Sametreiter (He is unable to write due to Parkinson's Disease). The additional Author signature will be added, together with an inscription of your choosing. </b></p>
