<p><b>Russian Asphalt: The experiences of the Waffen-SS soldier on the Eastern Front – Hazel Toon-Thorn</b></p>
<p>'Russian Asphalt' provides a series of personal insights into some of the experiences of the fighting soldiers of the Waffen-SS 
during their time on the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1945. 
<p>This is a collection of personal memories from various soldiers who ranged from Grenadiers to Kompanie Commanders, 
and also include a soldier awarded the Knight’s Cross to the Iron Cross for his bravery. 
These memories begin the heady days of the initial Barbarossa invasion in mid-1941 and end near the capital of the Third Reich, Berlin, 
in 1945. 
<p>The men who have been kind enough to recount their memories served in the following Waffen-SS formations: 
Leibstandarte SS-Adolf Hitler (Friedel Speckhardt, Manfred Thorn, Kurt Sametreiter, Erwin Bartmann, Georg Ott, Gert Pries), 
SS-Wiking (Paul Rosch, Gunther Adam, Jan Munk and Heinz Graber), 
plus Hans Kemnitzer who provides a great insight into life as a Russian prisoner of war. 
<p>Some of the men featured in these pages have sadly died since they were kind enough to talk to the Author. 
These recollections are in their own words, without editing. This is deliberate and aimed at increasing your 
knowledge of the Second World War. <p>The book format and contents are:
