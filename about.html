				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Who are we?</b><br />
					Established in 2013 with the sole purpose of bringing WWII personal archives into the wider market.<br /><br />
					<b>Experience?</b><br />
					Over 25 years of research on the subject of the Waffen-SS in WWII, together with 15 years of face-to-face contact with veterans who served within the ranks of the Waffen-SS.<br /><br />
					<b>Purpose?</b><br />
					Those who have had direct contact with the veterans of the Waffen-SS have been lucky enough to have seen personal archives containing photographs, documents and medals. From time to time, these archives move into the ownership of non-veteran individuals. These archives will, in most cases, go into a secure location and only be seen by a handful of choice people.<br /><br />
					Our aim is to help ensure that these historically important archives get the chance to be seen by a wider audience, whilst protecting the integrity of the original collections. A key aim is to identify how these archives can help portray the accurate history of the Waffen-SS during WWII. The ability to do this without political prejudice, pre-conceived ideas or 'agenda' is paramount.<br /><br />
					<center><b>LAH Publishing does not hold any political convictions of any type, or towards any particular 'cause', 'flag' or ideology, but is purely interested in the military history of the Waffen-SS</b></center>
